# ThermalSatReport
I got a new toy. A thermal receipt printer! Sure, I could have it spit out a shopping list or crank out a sheet every time a Tweet comes through from various people. But let's have it present me with a list of amateur radio satellite passes for a 24 hour period so I can plan which birds to wave my Yagi around at.
